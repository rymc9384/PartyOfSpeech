### 1) EVALUATING K = [30,31,...,60]
########################


Work outside in from both sides until a model is found that satisfies the 
standard set by Quinn et al. (2010) - i.e., topics generally correspond to 
areas of government. Also want to see some of the important categories from 
Grimmer (2013) - e.g., local services funding, salient issues of debate.


##############
## 30 Topics:

- Generally good coverage of agencies/issues:
	- E.g., Energy, human trafficking, student loans, guns, water, jobs, VA,
		education, drugs, judicial, small businesss, consumer protection, 
		health care, fire dept grants, Iran deal, defense, zika, homeland 
		security, taxes, budget, trade, EPA
		
- Still missing some important topics/agencies:
	- E.g., banking, transportation, agriculture, civil rights, 
		sexual/domestic violence, FEMA, rememberance,
		HUD, immigration, children
		
- Based on high prob docs, topics appear to be too broad 

- Conclusion: Too few topics


##############
## 60 Topics:

- Has what is missing from the model w/ 30 topics:
	- E.g., banking (4), agriculture (7), sexual/domestic violence (15), 
		immigration (35), FEMA (52)
		
- Some duplicated topics, or strangely mixed:
	- E.g., women health care (25) and planned parenthood (58); human 
		trafficking mixed with zika (45); academy nominations and 
		guantanamo (57)
	
- Conclusion: too many topics


##############
## 31 Topics:

- Banking/finance (4) and rememberance (13) topics appeared
	- both are too broad though - banking includes consumer protection
	
- Still missing lots of the important topics (see notes for model w/ K=30)

- Conclusion: Too few topics


##############
## 59 Topics:

	- E.g., Train safety (18); human rights in Cuba (19)

- Other strange mixes that appeared in K=60 are still there
	
- Conclusion: too many topics
