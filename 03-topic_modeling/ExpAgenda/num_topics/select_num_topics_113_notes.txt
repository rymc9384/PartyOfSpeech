### 1) EVALUATING K = [30,31,...,60]
########################


Work outside in from both sides until a model is found that satisfies the 
standard set by Quinn et al. (2010) - i.e., topics generally correspond to 
areas of government. Also want to see some of the important categories from 
Grimmer (2013) - e.g., local services funding, salient issues of debate.


##############
## 30 Topics:

- Generally good coverage of agencies/issues:
	- E.g., taxes, immigration, FEMA, funding, trade, education, VA, 
		business, grants (firefighting), agriculture, drugs, int'l relations, 
		water, air travel, military, nat'l lands, judicial, gun violence,
		children 
		
- Still missing some important topics/agencies:
	- E.g., HUD/HHS, consumer protection, banking/finance, transportation 
	
- Topics too broad based on doc samples -- e.g., defense and sexual/domestic 
  violence mixed (1)

- Conclusion: Too few topics
