# Part-of-speech Tagging

In the paper I rely on the POS tagger described in Toutanova et al. (2003) as implemented by StanfordNLP. The code for this can be found in the `/Tagging/` folder.

Alternatively, the `/bilstm_char/` folder contains code to train a BiLSTM-Character tagging model. 
That code runs on the free sample of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank data -- available via the NLTK library (Bird, Klein and Loper 2009).
