# Data Descriptives

This folder contains code for various data descriptives. The ``/documents/`` 
folder contains code for cross-tabs with the number of press releases 
(e.g., \# of releases by senator). The ``/topics/`` folder has code to produce 
a plot comparing the number of releases from the "Iran Deal" topic and external 
events. Finally, the ``/PTB/`` folder contains code to compare the prevalence 
of particular POS tags in the Senate (114th) corpus and the *WSJ* sample 
available in NLTK.
